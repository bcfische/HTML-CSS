Latitude

Here, we develop a visualization dashboard website using HTML and CSS to plot weather data. In building this dashboard, we create
individual pages for each plot and a means by which to navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations
and their corresponding explanations. There's also a landing page, where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another
page where we can view the data used to build them.
